# Enabling Sustainable Agriculture for Smallholder Farmers in Rural Kenya

## Our Mission
Enable 1 million smallholder farmers in rural Kenya to grow food sustainably and consistently throughout the year whilst coping up with the erratic rainfall patterns.

## The Problem
All field crops need soil (Medium), water, air (Carbon Dioxide), and light (Photosynthesis) to grow. The soil gives stability to the plants; it also stores the water and nutrients which the plants can take up through their roots. However, smallholder farmers in rural Kenya face several challenges:

1. Capacity & Knowledge Gap
2. Inaccessible credit facility
3. Water Infrastructure

## The Solution
We provide a comprehensive solution to address the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in rural Kenya:

1. Capacity building & knowledge dissemination training
2. Offer water harvesting equipment, water storage, and irrigation systems through a financing model

## Deployment Strategy
1. Location-based research
2. Smallholder farmers soil and water management training
3. Farmland analysis for water needs and soil testing
4. Financing & installation of water harvesting and storage equipment
5. Loan repayment & after-sales service by agronomists

## Why Now?
We aim to facilitate sustainable, year-round crop growth, mitigating the challenges posed by unpredictable rainfall patterns. By providing smallholder farmers with the necessary tools, knowledge, and support, we can help them adapt to the changing climate and ensure a stable food supply for their communities.
